# KSB Library

An app to create and manage local libraries of KSB evidence

## Why does it exist?

To provide an interface for storing, accessing, and editing evidence relating to the required Knowledge, Skills, and Behaviours of apprenticeship courses - while tracking which KSBs the evidence is linked to. It then allows this to be exported into a `.zip` of evidence ready to submit as part of the End Point Assessment.

## How does it work?

You first select a folder on your computer - either to create a library, or to load an existing one into the app. When creating a library, you will be prompted to create or load an apprenticeship standard, which includes your KSBs. These will then be saved in the library. As you add evidence, your library gets populated, and you can filter by each K, S, and B to check your progress.

## Security-first approach

Since a lot of KSB evidence could be confidential or otherwise legally protected, this app does not store the images anywhere remotely, and all processing is done locally. When you upload evidence, it simply saves to your library location.

## What if I want it synced?

Since KSB Library doesn't use the cloud, it does mean that only one copy of your data exists by default. However, if you set the location of your library to a cloud location, such as a folder synced with OneDrive or Google Drive, the library will be accessible across devices.
